Create an application which will connect with your google account and will show first three
images from selected album (Picasa). User should be able to add comments. Please don't
use any existing library for Picasa API and OAuth. Flow should look this:

1. Login screen - where user can login via his/her google account,
2. Album list - after login the user will see the list of all owned albums from Google Picasa account,
3. Images view - the user will see first three images from selected album,
4. User is able to comment a photo.
